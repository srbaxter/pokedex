# pokedex

## Overview
This project uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to search and display results from a Pokédex.<br/>
It was created with the Vue CLI to use Vue 3, Vue Router, Babel, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest.<br/>
All Vue 3 code uses the Composition API instead of the Options API (i.e. uses setup()).
